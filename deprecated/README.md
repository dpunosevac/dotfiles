# Deprecated Dotfiles

These are dotfiles that are no longer used, either because I do not use the utility or made a new configuration.

## Midnight Commander

It's a decent file manager, especially when dealing with a large number of files.
However, it's slow to launch, keybindings are atrocious, and features are generally not intuitive.
For browsing directories quickly, I use [lf](../lf/lfrc), and when I need to bulk-rename files/directories, I prefer [Emacs Dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) or [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim).

## Mutt

It's the best CLI email client.
But that doesn't say a lot these days where all emails are essentially embedded HTML websites.
Even with `w3m` integration, I found myself not using Mutt at all as I always have Thunderbird open on my computer.
