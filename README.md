# Theo's dotfiles
Here are dotfiles for my system, currently 2020 Macbook Air with M1 processor.
I try to make it as generic as possible, and  it should work on most devices with a little pre-requisite.

## Pre-requisites (in order of importance)
- UNIX/Linux machine
- Git and internet connection (to clone the repo)
- Z Shell (no oh-my-zsh!!)
- Bourne Again Shell
- Vim
- NeoVim
- Homebrew (you'll get a confirmation for this in the shell script)

## Usage
Clone this repository in the home directory
`cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles.git`
Run the installation script
`zsh theo_dotfiles_install.sh`

# Highlight

## .bashrc

## .zshrc && .zsh_plugin

## .gitconfig

## .vimrc

## .config/nvim

## Brewfile

## macos_settings.sh
