# Theo's dotfiles
Here are dotfiles for my system, currently 2020 Macbook Air with M1 processor.
I try to make it as generic as possible, and  it should work on most devices with a little pre-requisites.
Dots in front of the files in repo are removed for readability reason, which is ironic.
Don't worry, assuming my script works, it should create symbolic links with dots in front of the file names.

## Pre-requisites (in order of importance)
- UNIX/Linux machine
- Git and internet connection (to clone the repo)
- Z Shell (no oh-my-zsh!!)
- Bourne Again Shell
- Vim
- NeoVim
- Homebrew (you'll get a confirmation for this in the shell script)

## Usage
Clone this repository in the home directory.
`git clone https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`
Run the installation script (might ask for a password).
`zsh ~/dotfiles/dotfiles_install.sh`

# Highlights

## zshrc && zsh_plugin

## gitconfig && gitignore

## vimrc

## config/nvim

## Brewfile

## macos_settings.sh
